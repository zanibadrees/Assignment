introducation
My name is Zanib Adrees. I have completed a Master's in Computer Science, and I am currently working as an RPA Developer at Jeeny. This is my first job. Initially, I wanted to become a Data Engineer, but since I couldn’t find an opportunity in that field, I decided to take up this role when it came my way. I thought I would switch domains later on.<br>

Although I worked as an RPA Developer, I didn’t develop much interest in it. For some time now, I’ve been applying for Data Engineer positions, but I haven’t received any responses. That’s when I decided to start a Data Analytics course at Atomcamp, which my friend had recommended to me.<br>
Right now, my main focus is to become a skilled Data Engineer or Data Analyst. You could call it my goal. I want to grow in this field and build a successful career.
